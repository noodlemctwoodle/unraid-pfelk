# UnRAID - pfELK Docker Container

This project is a Frankenstein of open source projects, the config of [pfelk](https://github.com/3ilson/pfelk) and the container of [sebp/elk](https://hub.docker.com/r/sebp/elk/) with a few modifications to pull in the pfELK configuration files. I've not built a public container before so please bare with me.

I am open to suggestions for fixing any bugs. 👍 This will allow you to run pfELK on your UnRAID server.

## Container Requirements

### Known Issues

- For some reason `png` images are not showing in the guide or in my git, I'm not sure why I've added images a million times to Git but today they aren't working.
- The Container is showing `not available` in UnRAID for update, I've added it to my bugs, not sure how to fix it..
